# Buoyant Timer - Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 13, 2025**

Wrobele sp. z o.o. ("Wrobele," "we," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. Buoyant Timer is a simple timer application currently available for macOS, and we designed it to respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes what information *we do not collect* and how we handle your data. By using the Buoyant Timer app ("the App”), you acknowledge that you accept this Privacy Policy.

## No Personal Data Collected

**Buoyant Timer does not collect any personal information or user data.** We do not require you to provide any personal details to use the App, and we do not gather analytics or tracking information. In particular, the App **does NOT collect**:

* **Personal Identifiers:** No names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact details are collected.

* **Sensitive Information:** No location data, health data, financial information, or any other sensitive personal data is collected.

* **Usage or Diagnostics:** The App does not record how you use it, and it does not send crash reports or analytics to us.

Because we collect no data, **Buoyant Timer does not transmit or share any information** from your device. In short, *we log no information about you and have no interest in doing so*. Your privacy is fully respected by the App’s design.

## Data Stored on Your Device

All information related to your use of Buoyant Timer (for example, your timer settings or preferences) remains on your device. The App is fully **sandboxed** and works entirely offline, which means it does not connect to any servers or external services. Any data the App handles is stored locally (within your device’s storage) and never leaves your device. We have **no access** to this data. Even as we expand Buoyant Timer to other platforms like Windows, the same principle will apply: your data stays on your device and is not uploaded or transmitted to us.

## No Third-Party Services or Integrations

Buoyant Timer does not use any third-party analytics providers, advertising networks, or social media plugins. The App is self-contained and does not incorporate external SDKs or integrations that would collect data. We also do not share any data with third parties, because the App itself does not collect or generate any personal data to share.

Please note that when you download the App through the Apple App Store (or in the future, Microsoft Store), those platform providers might collect certain information (such as aggregate download numbers, crash logs, or other usage statistics) under their own policies. **Wrobele sp. z o.o. does not receive any personal information** about users from Apple, Microsoft, or any app store. We have no access to any data that could identify you.

## Support and Contact Communications

Because the App itself doesn’t collect data, the only time we might receive personal information is if **you choose to contact us** for support or feedback. If you email us at our support address (**hello@wrobele.com**), we will receive your email address and any information you include in your message. We will **only use this information to communicate with you about your inquiry** or issue:

* **Support Emails:** If you reach out for help or to provide feedback, we may retain your email and correspondence in order to resolve your issue or respond to your comments. We will use your email address **solely to reply to you** regarding your support request or feedback.

* **No Marketing Use:** We will **not** use your email address for marketing purposes or add you to any mailing lists without your explicit consent. Contacting us will not result in unsolicited emails from us.

* **Retention of Communication:** We may keep the support correspondence for a period of time (to refer back to previous communications or improve the App), but we will not share your message or email address with anyone else.

## Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

Since we do not collect personal data through Buoyant Timer, **we have no information to disclose to third parties**. We do not sell, trade, or rent any user data. In particular, we will not disclose any information about you to any third party, except in the rare event that it is required by law or legal process. For example, if we are ever legally compelled by a government or regulatory authority to provide information (and we actually have any relevant data, which in this case would only be something you voluntarily provided like a support email), we would only comply to the extent required by law. In short, **unless you expressly consent or the law requires, we will not share your data** with anyone.

## Children’s Privacy

Buoyant Timer does not knowingly collect any personal information - from children or anyone else. The App is not directed to children under 13, but since the App does not collect data at all, it does not collect information from users of any age. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has somehow provided personal information to us (for example, via sending a support email), please contact us. We will promptly delete any such information and correspondence. However, by design, the App itself does not gather or transmit personal data from any user, including minors.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future, for example if we introduce new features that involve data or if legal requirements change. If we make changes, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our website (and update the "Last updated" date at the top). **We encourage you to review this page periodically** for any updates. If any significant changes are made to how we handle your data, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with legal requirements. By continuing to use the App after any changes to this Policy are posted, you acknowledge the updated Policy.
